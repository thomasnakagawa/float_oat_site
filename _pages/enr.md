Experimental Noise Room is an Android app that lets you play with a bunch of instruments I made up.

There are three instruments to create music with:
- Route painter: Create melodies by drawing on a canvas
- Drum Groove Machine: Create and manipulate drum loops on a spinning disk
- Feedback pendulum: Create feedback tones by swinging microphones above a speaker.

Also, there are three pieces of equipment for manipulating the sound of the instruments:
- Effect pedals: Change the sound of the instruments with distortion, pitch shifting, delay, flanging and equalizing.
- Lo-fi tape recorder: Record, playback and loop the instruments
- Mixer: Change the volume of each instrument.
